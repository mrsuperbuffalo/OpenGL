## How to

There is a lot of information on OpenGL. I am having a hard time trying to get
use the C++(mostly) tutorials converted to python. Most of the problems lie with
how I instantiate the GL functions. I am not able to see what is available to me
so I cannot even begin to look for something. I wish I had remembered this from
last time. I think I should look to see what Matt has in his repo and see how
they match up with the tutorials. I should also probably write what I am
learning from the tutorials into another location so that I can remember what
each component is capable in a manor that I understand.

This will probably need to happen at a later date.
