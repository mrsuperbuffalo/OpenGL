## Goal

To develop a replacement NDPlot using OpenGL.


### Why?

There are many limitations to using vtk as our plotting utility. We have very
little control over how we can interact with the plot and the integration of it
with Qt.

### How?

I'm not sure yet. I need to be able to create the various components in the
space. After that I believe interaction should be easy enough.

### Target

I am going to attempt to target opengl version 4.1 because that's what this
laptop maxes out at and I believe it will work out better if I attempt to learn
something that should be applicable much later.
